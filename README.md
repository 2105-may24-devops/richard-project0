# file backup system

A local file backup system, capable of:
-copying a user specified file into a pretermined primary folder, maintaining the existing file extension
-copying the same file into a secondary folder, addeding the file extension
-keep a changelog of files being added to the system

With a file added to the system, users are able to:
-restore a file from backup to a user input location, or restore to the original file location
-update a file already in backup, overwriting the exiting copies in primary and secondary folder, and updating the changelog to reflect the update to the file
-remove a file from the backup system, deleting the copies stored in primary and secondary folders
-view the changelog to review actions taken in the system
